## 1. Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

The Cat Facts App is a simple React application that fetches a random cat fact from the 'https://catfact.ninja/fact' API endpoint. Upon loading, the app displays a loading GIF to simulate data fetching. After fetching the cat fact, it displays the fact along with a cat image and a button to generate new cat facts. When the button is clicked, a new cat fact is fetched, and the loading GIF is displayed until the new fact is retrieved.
